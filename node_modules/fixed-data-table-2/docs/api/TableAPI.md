`Table` (component)
===================

Data grid component with fixed or scrollable header and columns.

The layout of the data table is as follows:

```
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Fixed Column Group    | Scrollable Column Group   |
| Header                | Header                    |
|                       |                           |
+---------------------------------------------------+
|                       |                           |

```

- Fixed Column Group Header: These are the headers for a group
  of columns if included in the table that do not scroll
  vertically or horizontally.

- Scrollable Column Group Header: The header for a group of columns
  that do not move while scrolling vertically, but move horizontally
  with the horizontal scrolling.

- Fixed Header Columns: The header columns that do not move while scrolling
  vertically or horizontally.

- Scrollable Header Columns: The header columns that do not move
  while scrolling vertically, but move horizontally with the horizontal
  scrolling.

- Fixed Body Columns: The body columns that do not move while scrolling
  horizontally, but move vertically with the vertical scrolling.

- Scrollable Body Columns: The body columns that move while scrolling
  vertically or horizontally.

Props
-----

### `width` (required)

Pixel width of table. If all columns do not fit,
a horizontal scrollbar will appear.

type: `number`


### `height`

Pixel height of table. If all rows do not fit,
a vertical scrollbar will appear.

Either `height` or `maxHeight` must be specified.

type: `number`


### `className`

Class name to be passed into parent container

type: `string`


### `maxHeight`

Maximum pixel height of table. If all rows do not fit,
a vertical scrollbar will appear.

Either `height` or `maxHeight` must be specified.

type: `number`


### `ownerHeight`

Pixel height of table's owner, this is used in a managed scrolling
situation when you want to slide the table up from below the fold
without having to constantly update the height on every scroll tick.
Instead, vary this property on scroll. By using `ownerHeight`, we
over-render the table while making sure the footer and horizontal
scrollbar of the table are visible when the current space for the table
in view is smaller than the final, over-flowing height of table. It
allows us to avoid resizing and reflowing table when it is moving in the
view.

This is used if `ownerHeight < height` (or `maxHeight`).

type: `number`


### `overflowX`

type: `enum('hidden'|'auto')`


### `overflowY`

type: `enum('hidden'|'auto')`


### `touchScrollEnabled`

Boolean flag indicating of touch scrolling should be enabled
This feature is current in beta and may have bugs

type: `bool`
defaultValue: `false`


### `keyboardScrollEnabled`

Boolean flags to control if scrolling with keys is enabled

type: `bool`
defaultValue: `false`


### `keyboardPageEnabled`

type: `bool`
defaultValue: `false`


### `showScrollbarX`

Hide the scrollbar but still enable scroll functionality

type: `bool`
defaultValue: `true`


### `showScrollbarY`

type: `bool`
defaultValue: `true`


### `onHorizontalScroll`

Callback when horizontally scrolling the grid.

Return false to stop propagation.

type: `func`


### `onVerticalScroll`

Callback when vertically scrolling the grid.

Return false to stop propagation.

type: `func`


### `rowsCount` (required)

Number of rows in the table.

type: `number`


### `rowHeight` (required)

Pixel height of rows unless `rowHeightGetter` is specified and returns
different value.

type: `number`


### `rowHeightGetter`

If specified, `rowHeightGetter(index)` is called for each row and the
returned value overrides `rowHeight` for particular row.

type: `func`


### `subRowHeight`

Pixel height of sub-row unless `subRowHeightGetter` is specified and returns
different value.  Defaults to 0 and no sub-row being displayed.

type: `number`


### `subRowHeightGetter`

If specified, `subRowHeightGetter(index)` is called for each row and the
returned value overrides `subRowHeight` for particular row.

type: `func`


### `rowExpanded`

The row expanded for table row.
This can either be a React element, or a function that generates
a React Element. By default, the React element passed in can expect to
receive the following props:

```
props: {
  rowIndex; number // (the row index)
  height: number // (supplied from the Table or rowHeightGetter)
  width: number // (supplied from the Table)
}
```

Because you are passing in your own React element, you can feel free to
pass in whatever props you may want or need.

If you pass in a function, you will receive the same props object as the
first argument.

type: `union(element|func)`


### `rowClassNameGetter`

To get any additional CSS classes that should be added to a row,
`rowClassNameGetter(index)` is called.

type: `func`


### `rowKeyGetter`

If specified, `rowKeyGetter(index)` is called for each row and the
returned value overrides `key` for the particular row.

type: `func`


### `groupHeaderHeight`

Pixel height of the column group header.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `0`


### `headerHeight` (required)

Pixel height of header.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `0`


### `cellGroupWrapperHeight`

Pixel height of fixedDataTableCellGroupLayout/cellGroupWrapper.
Default is headerHeight and groupHeaderHeight.

This can be used with CSS to make a header cell span both the group & normal header row.
Setting this to a value larger than height will cause the content to
overflow the height. This is useful when adding a 2nd table as the group
header and vertically merging the 2 headers when a column is not part
of a group. Here are the necessary CSS changes:

Both headers:
 - cellGroupWrapper needs overflow-x: hidden and pointer-events: none
 - cellGroup needs pointer-events: auto to reenable them on child els
Group header:
 - Layout/main needs overflow: visible and a higher z-index
 - CellLayout/main needs overflow-y: visible
 - cellGroup needs overflow: visible

type: `number`


### `footerHeight`

Pixel height of footer.

type: `number`
defaultValue: `0`


### `scrollLeft`

Value of horizontal scroll.

type: `number`


### `scrollToColumn`

Index of column to scroll to.

type: `number`


### `scrollTop`

Value of vertical scroll.

type: `number`


### `scrollToRow`

Index of row to scroll to.

type: `number`


### `onScrollStart`

Callback that is called when scrolling starts with current horizontal
and vertical scroll values.

type: `func`


### `onScrollEnd`

Callback that is called when scrolling ends or stops with new horizontal
and vertical scroll values.

type: `func`


### `stopScrollPropagation`

If enabled scroll events will not be propagated outside of the table.

type: `bool`
defaultValue: `false`


### `onContentHeightChange`

Callback that is called when `rowHeightGetter` returns a different height
for a row than the `rowHeight` prop. This is necessary because initially
table estimates heights of some parts of the content.

type: `func`


### `onRowClick`

Callback that is called when a row is clicked.

type: `func`


### `onRowDoubleClick`

Callback that is called when a row is double clicked.

### `onRowMouseUp`

Callback that is called when a mouse-up event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onRowMouseEnter`

Callback that is called when a mouse-enter event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onRowMouseLeave`

Callback that is called when a mouse-leave event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onRowTouchStart`

Callback that is called when a touch-start event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onRowTouchEnd`

Callback that is called when a touch-end event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onRowTouchMove`

Callback that is called when a touch-move event happens on a row.

type: `func`


### `onColumnResizeEndCallback`

```
function(
  newColumnWidth: number,
  columnKey: string,
)
```

type: `func`


### `onColumnReorderEndCallback`

and columns need to be updated.

```
function(
  event {
    columnBefore: string|undefined, // the column before the new location of this one
    columnAfter: string|undefined,  // the column after the new location of this one
    reorderColumn: string,          // the column key that was just reordered
  }
)
```
